# 🧑‍💻 User Management System in C++

## 📌 Project Description
This is a console-based **User Management System** developed using C++. It allows users to register, log in,
view the list of registered users, search for a specific user, and delete accounts.
It uses **file handling** to store user data persistently in a text file (`DataBase.txt`) and demonstrates secure password validation with basic rules.

## 🎯 Features
- ✅ **User Registration** with password validation:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one digit
  - At least one special character
- 🔐 **Login Functionality** with verification
- 📂 **Persistent Storage** using file I/O
- 📃 **Display Registered Users**
- 🔍 **Search for a User**
- ❌ **Delete an Existing User**
- ⚠️ **Input Validation** and custom exception handling for incorrect inputs

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Language: **C++**
- Concepts Used:
  - Classes & Objects
  - File I/O (`ifstream`, `ofstream`)
  - Exception Handling (`try-catch`, custom exceptions)
  - STL Vectors
  - Input Validation


📌 Future Improvements
Password encryption instead of plain text

GUI version using C++ GUI frameworks (like Qt or SFML)

Login attempt limits

Admin dashboard for managing users
